INVESTMENT API
This is a full working website application which has been integrated into jinja template for a better user integration.
But for security reasons i had to keep the templates folder, so you can easily do a little cleanup on each of the endpoint so you can have a json response instead of the html page that is being served upon interacting with the endpoint.

HOW TO RUN
Create a virtualenv
activate the virtualenv
do pip install -r requiremrnts.txt
and then run python app.py



You can get in touch if you need assistance
